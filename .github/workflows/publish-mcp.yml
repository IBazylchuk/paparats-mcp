# Publishes server.json to the MCP Registry when a version tag is pushed or a GitHub Release is published.
# Prerequisites: server.json in repo root; @paparats/cli (and @paparats/shared) must already be published to npm —
# the registry validates the package and returns 400 "NPM package not found" until it exists. Publish locally with
# yarn publish:npm first, then push the tag (or re-run this workflow after publishing).
