### Minor Changes

- [#56](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/56) [`aafbfc2`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/aafbfc2e98679357f87b98b72f7c1a7155207e23) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - Add change-detection to the indexer. Two cron schedules now run side by side: a fast `CRON_FAST` tick (default `*/10 * * * *`) that fingerprints each repo and only re-indexes when it changed, and a slow `CRON` safety-net (default `0 */3 * * *`, was `0 */6 * * *`) that still does a full pass. Remote repos use `git ls-remote HEAD`; bind-mounted local repos use a file mtime/size hash. State persists in `STATE_DB_PATH` (default `/data/indexer-state.db`). Set `CHANGE_DETECTION=false` to opt out.

  `onboard_to_project`, `triage_incident`, `prepare_release_notes`,
  `assess_change_impact`) and enforce mode isolation between `/mcp` and
  `/support/mcp` so a coding session id cannot be replayed on the support

The `projects.yml` header now documents every supported per-entry field. Existing entries are left untouched.

### Minor Changes

- [#49](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/49) [`72aab0c`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/72aab0cf524584cbf13eff25ec1fe3afe7c4e185) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - Rework the install/CLI flow around a single global home, add indexer hot-reload, and clean up the symbol graph.

  **CLI**
  - Replace per-project `init` / `index` / `watch` with a unified `install` plus `add` / `remove` / `list` / `edit` / `lifecycle` subcommands working off `~/.paparats/`.
  - Persist install configuration in `install.json` so `paparats add` / `remove` can regenerate `docker-compose.yml` without losing context.
  - Add `--force` to `paparats add` — drops the project's existing chunks before reindexing (use after schema or config changes).
  - Drop the legacy `lsp-installers` / `init` / `watch` modules and their tests.

  **Indexer**
  - Hot-reload `~/.paparats/projects.yml` via a chokidar `ConfigWatcher`. Added/modified repos reindex live; removed repos drop bookkeeping. No restart needed for metadata-only edits.
  - Accept `{repos?, force?}` body on `POST /trigger`; `force: true` drops the project's existing chunks before reindexing.
  - Bind-mount the whole `~/.paparats` as `/config:ro` (directory mount, not single-file) so atomic rewrites of `projects.yml` survive — single-file mounts pin to host inode and break on rename.

  **Project list rename**
  - Renamed `~/.paparats/paparats-indexer.yml` → `~/.paparats/projects.yml`. The CLI reads `projects` semantics throughout (`paparats edit projects`, etc.) so the file name now matches.
  - `paparats install` automatically renames a legacy `paparats-indexer.yml` to `projects.yml` on first run and prints a one-line notice. No manual migration needed.
  - Both the CLI and the indexer fall back to reading `paparats-indexer.yml` when `projects.yml` is absent, so an out-of-sync upgrade (e.g. new indexer image, old CLI) keeps working.

  **Server**
  - `syncGroupsFromQdrant` now also enumerates projects per group via `listProjectsInGroup` and rebuilds `ProjectConfig` from payload, while preserving any explicit `POST /api/index` registrations.
  - `ast-symbol-extractor`: filter out symbols declared inside function bodies (locals, callback args, hook closures). Module-level only — these are the only symbols meaningful for cross-chunk reference analysis. Adds two coverage tests.

  **Docs**
  - Full README rewrite to match the new install flow, project model, and the actual MCP tool set.

- [#50](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/50) [`d478587`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/d4785877da0a8d67948777441fda3181c6ec0bec) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - fix(group): default to a shared `default` group instead of project name

  A regression introduced when `paparats add` landed silently siloed every
  project in its own Qdrant collection, breaking the multi-project model
  ("group = collection, projects share via the `project` payload filter").

  What changed:
  - `@paparats/shared` exports `DEFAULT_GROUP = 'default'` as the single
    source of truth.
  - `paparats add` no longer writes `group: <name>` when `--group` is
    omitted — the entry inherits `defaults.group` from `projects.yml` or
    falls back to `DEFAULT_GROUP`. CLI `list` / `remove` resolve through
    the same path.
  - The indexer container falls back to `DEFAULT_GROUP` (still respects
    `PAPARATS_GROUP` env and per-repo `group:` override).
  - `autoProjectConfig` in the server falls back to `DEFAULT_GROUP`.
  - `Indexer.indexProject` now evicts the project's chunks from any other
    group before indexing, so a project that was renamed out of its old
    group doesn't leave behind stale chunks (whose `chunk_id` would no
    longer match symbol-graph edges, silently breaking `find_usages`).

  Migration: no action required for new installs. Existing installs with
  per-project groups continue to work — the eviction pass kicks in only
  when the project moves between groups.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#43](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/43) [`9051779`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/90517796873fbc537c44b4c9a87955a6cf009939) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - Bug fixes:
  - **`paparats --version` was hardcoded to `0.1.2`**: `packages/cli/src/index.ts` carried a literal version string that the release pipeline never touched, so the flag returned `0.1.2` regardless of what npm had actually installed. Version is now read from the package's own `package.json` at runtime, so it tracks the published version automatically.
  - **AST chunker emitted overlapping chunks for large single declarations**: when `splitNode` recursed into a named child that spanned only one line (e.g. the identifier of an `export const homeMarkdown = ...` with a long template literal body), the identifier produced its own (start, start) chunk while the body produced (start, end), leaving the identifier chunk as a redundant subset of the body chunk. Added a `dedupeContainedChunks` post-filter to drop chunks whose range is fully contained inside another chunk's range. Ties are broken by length, then by emission order.
  - **`.tsx` / `.jsx` files were parsed with the wrong tree-sitter grammar**: `detectLanguageByPath` returns `'typescript'` for `.tsx` (which keeps `LANGUAGE_PROFILES` simple), but `tree-sitter-typescript` does not understand JSX — tags parse as bogus type expressions and identifier usages inside `<Foo prop={x}/>` or `{value}` are lost. Added `resolveAstLanguage(language, relPath)` which upgrades to the `tsx` grammar for `.tsx`/`.jsx` paths at the AST boundary, leaving the higher-level language profile untouched.

  - Patch GHSA-protobufjs prototype-pollution / code-generation gadget (CVSS 8.1 High) by forcing `protobufjs ≥ 8.0.2` via root `resolutions`. The vulnerable 8.0.1 was a transitive dep of `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http` 0.217.0 — the resolution lifts it to 8.3.0 across the workspace. Dependabot couldn't auto-update because protobufjs is not a direct dep.

  - Patch 9 dependabot advisories via root `resolutions` (fast-uri ≥3.1.2, hono ≥4.12.18, ip-address ≥10.2.0, postcss ≥8.5.14). All four were transitive — pulled in via @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (hono), ajv (fast-uri), express-rate-limit + simple-git/socks (ip-address), and vite devDep (postcss). The advisories range from path traversal in URI parsing through to JWT timestamp validation; resolutions force every consumer onto the patched line without touching direct deps.
  - Bump Yarn to 4.14.1, @inquirer/prompts to ^8.4.3.
  - Fix flaky `ApiClient.abort` test: aborted requests were being retried with exponential backoff, blowing past the 5s test timeout. Abort errors now short-circuit retry like 4xx and parse errors.

- Updated dependencies [[`17c922f`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/17c922f78e3b02d6d8544dd1e89b25f76e081fb0)]:

### Minor Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/37) [`ee217da`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/ee217da9a19dd11416c4b74d3d527cd662e5b3aa) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - **Analytics & observability stack.** Adds a unified telemetry façade with three independently-toggleable sinks:
  - **Prometheus** (existing surface, unchanged) for `/metrics` scraping.
  - **Local SQLite analytics** at `~/.paparats/analytics.db` — raw search/tool/indexing events with 90-day retention. Six new MCP tools query it: `token_savings_report`, `top_queries`, `cross_project_share`, `retry_rate`, `slowest_searches`, `failed_chunks`.
  - **OpenTelemetry** (lazy-loaded) — OTLP/HTTP exporter with spans for every search, MCP tool call, embedding, indexing run, and chunking error. Works with Tempo, Jaeger, Honeycomb, Datadog, Grafana Cloud.

  **Header-based identity** (`X-Paparats-User`, `X-Paparats-Session`, `X-Paparats-Client`, `X-Paparats-Anchor-Project`) is propagated through `AsyncLocalStorage` so every event is attributed without changing call-site signatures. Identity is for attribution, not access control.

  **Three-level token-savings estimator** computed at query-time:
  - _Naive baseline_ — what the model would read if it pulled whole files.
  - _Search-only_ — tokens returned by `search_code`.
  - _Actually consumed_ — tokens the client subsequently fetched via `get_chunk`. The honest signal that discounts noisy results never used.

  **Cross-project noise** — when a client passes `X-Paparats-Anchor-Project` (or specifies a single project), the share of off-anchor results is recorded. The `cross_project_share` MCP tool surfaces this per user.

  **Indexing-pipeline observability** — `failed_chunks` aggregates AST parse failures, regex fallbacks, zero-chunk files, and binary skips. `slowest_searches` ranks by latency.

  See README.md → "Analytics & Observability" for the full configuration matrix and PII guidance.
