## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#43](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/43) [`9051779`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/90517796873fbc537c44b4c9a87955a6cf009939) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - Bug fixes:
  - **`paparats --version` was hardcoded to `0.1.2`**: `packages/cli/src/index.ts` carried a literal version string that the release pipeline never touched, so the flag returned `0.1.2` regardless of what npm had actually installed. Version is now read from the package's own `package.json` at runtime, so it tracks the published version automatically.
  - **AST chunker emitted overlapping chunks for large single declarations**: when `splitNode` recursed into a named child that spanned only one line (e.g. the identifier of an `export const homeMarkdown = ...` with a long template literal body), the identifier produced its own (start, start) chunk while the body produced (start, end), leaving the identifier chunk as a redundant subset of the body chunk. Added a `dedupeContainedChunks` post-filter to drop chunks whose range is fully contained inside another chunk's range. Ties are broken by length, then by emission order.
  - **`.tsx` / `.jsx` files were parsed with the wrong tree-sitter grammar**: `detectLanguageByPath` returns `'typescript'` for `.tsx` (which keeps `LANGUAGE_PROFILES` simple), but `tree-sitter-typescript` does not understand JSX — tags parse as bogus type expressions and identifier usages inside `<Foo prop={x}/>` or `{value}` are lost. Added `resolveAstLanguage(language, relPath)` which upgrades to the `tsx` grammar for `.tsx`/`.jsx` paths at the AST boundary, leaving the higher-level language profile untouched.

- [#44](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/44) [`8544dc8`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/8544dc83bb91203efbc6f61ad1eaa9f19353901f) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - Security bump:
  - Patch GHSA-protobufjs prototype-pollution / code-generation gadget (CVSS 8.1 High) by forcing `protobufjs ≥ 8.0.2` via root `resolutions`. The vulnerable 8.0.1 was a transitive dep of `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http` 0.217.0 — the resolution lifts it to 8.3.0 across the workspace. Dependabot couldn't auto-update because protobufjs is not a direct dep.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#41](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/41) [`17c922f`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/17c922f78e3b02d6d8544dd1e89b25f76e081fb0) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - Security and reliability bumps:
  - Patch 9 dependabot advisories via root `resolutions` (fast-uri ≥3.1.2, hono ≥4.12.18, ip-address ≥10.2.0, postcss ≥8.5.14). All four were transitive — pulled in via @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (hono), ajv (fast-uri), express-rate-limit + simple-git/socks (ip-address), and vite devDep (postcss). The advisories range from path traversal in URI parsing through to JWT timestamp validation; resolutions force every consumer onto the patched line without touching direct deps.
  - Bump Yarn to 4.14.1, @inquirer/prompts to ^8.4.3.
  - Fix flaky `ApiClient.abort` test: aborted requests were being retried with exponential backoff, blowing past the 5s test timeout. Abort errors now short-circuit retry like 4xx and parse errors.

- Updated dependencies [[`17c922f`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/17c922f78e3b02d6d8544dd1e89b25f76e081fb0)]:

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/pull/37) [`ee217da`](https://github.com/IBazylchuk/paparats-mcp/commit/ee217da9a19dd11416c4b74d3d527cd662e5b3aa) Thanks [@IBazylchuk](https://github.com/IBazylchuk)! - **Analytics & observability stack.** Adds a unified telemetry façade with three independently-toggleable sinks:
  - **Prometheus** (existing surface, unchanged) for `/metrics` scraping.
  - **Local SQLite analytics** at `~/.paparats/analytics.db` — raw search/tool/indexing events with 90-day retention. Six new MCP tools query it: `token_savings_report`, `top_queries`, `cross_project_share`, `retry_rate`, `slowest_searches`, `failed_chunks`.
  - **OpenTelemetry** (lazy-loaded) — OTLP/HTTP exporter with spans for every search, MCP tool call, embedding, indexing run, and chunking error. Works with Tempo, Jaeger, Honeycomb, Datadog, Grafana Cloud.

  **Header-based identity** (`X-Paparats-User`, `X-Paparats-Session`, `X-Paparats-Client`, `X-Paparats-Anchor-Project`) is propagated through `AsyncLocalStorage` so every event is attributed without changing call-site signatures. Identity is for attribution, not access control.

  **Three-level token-savings estimator** computed at query-time:
  - _Naive baseline_ — what the model would read if it pulled whole files.
  - _Search-only_ — tokens returned by `search_code`.
  - _Actually consumed_ — tokens the client subsequently fetched via `get_chunk`. The honest signal that discounts noisy results never used.

  **Cross-project noise** — when a client passes `X-Paparats-Anchor-Project` (or specifies a single project), the share of off-anchor results is recorded. The `cross_project_share` MCP tool surfaces this per user.

  **Indexing-pipeline observability** — `failed_chunks` aggregates AST parse failures, regex fallbacks, zero-chunk files, and binary skips. `slowest_searches` ranks by latency.

  See README.md → "Analytics & Observability" for the full configuration matrix and PII guidance.
